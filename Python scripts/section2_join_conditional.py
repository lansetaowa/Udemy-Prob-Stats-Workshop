# section2 topic: join probability, conditional probability

# terminologies:
    # compound probability, dependent, independent
    # conditional probability: P(A&B) = P(A|B) * P(B)
    # joint probability: several events happening together
    # check indenpendence: if independent, then P(A) = P(A|B), and P(A&B) = P(A)*P(B)
