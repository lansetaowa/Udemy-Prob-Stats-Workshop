## About this repo
This is a Udemy course I recently took in Sept 2024 to recap knowledges in Probability and Statistics to prepare for any upcoming interviews, as well as to keep a record to future review.

## Topics
This course covers all basic probability and statistics topics in a workshop style.

Probability:
- joint and conditional probability
- bayes rules
- permutation and combination

Statistics:
- binomial distribution
- normal distribution
- t distribution
- joint random variables
- sampling
- hypothesis testing
- linear regression
- multiple regression

## My codes
The instructor in this course uses Excel and distribution tables to demostrate concepts and showcase applications. In the meantime, I created a Python script for each section, and wrote Python codes to solve problems. I mainly used modules such as **scipy.stats** for statistical distribution calculation and **numpy** for math calculation.
